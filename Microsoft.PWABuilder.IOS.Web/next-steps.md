# Next steps for getting your PWA into the Apple iOS Store
You've successfully generated an iOS App Store app package for your PWA. 😎

Your next steps:
1. **Build your project** in Xcode
2. **Test your app**: Run your project in Xcode to try out your PWA on an iPhone emulator.
3. **Submit your app to Apple iOS App Store**

Each step is explained below.

## 1. Build your project in Xcode

Your zip file contains a `src` folder containing the source code for your iOS app. You'll need a Mac to build this project.

Unzip the `src` folder and open a terminal in `src` and execute the following command:

`pod install`

Then, open `src/pwa-shell.xcworkspace`

This will open the project in Xcode. In Xcode, click the `Product` > `Build` to build your project.

## 2. Test your app an iPhone emulator

With the project opened in Xcode, click ▶️ to run your PWA in an iPhone emulator. 

## 3. Upload your app to the iOS App Store

Your app is ready to be uploaded to the iOS App Store.

Follow [Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/) for submitting your app to the Store.
